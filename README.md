## About
Project developed under MIT License which permits to reuse the code as long as copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.
It is an amateur project to show the flexibility of TCL scripting programming language. Game adjusts to settings written by the user. TCL Script that I would like you to present you
is quite elaborate and unscramble. To nail the code I added some debug features. Code is not aimed to be an example of good code practice. The aim of the project was to learn the new language.
## Rules
Game consist of area 10x10 from A to J and from 0 to 9. Each player has 8 ships with proper size:
two 1-funnel,
two 2-funnel,
two 3-funnel,
one 4-decker,
one 5-decker. Before play begins, each run script secretly arranges their ships on their primary grid. 
One of the scripts starts game consistently and repeatedly giving the feedback to the second player. Computer is prepared to hold and reuse 
as much information as it can to apply it to the game making it easier for themself to win. The good example is marking the around area of sunken ship.
